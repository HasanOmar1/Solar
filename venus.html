          <p>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest
            planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or
            rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
            similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however
            – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and
            it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric
            acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the
            hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to
            the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees
            Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The
            surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched
            mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s
            possible some volcanoes are still active.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times
            that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below
            the ocean on Earth.
