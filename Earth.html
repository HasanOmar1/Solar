            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place
            we know of so far that's inhabited by living things.

            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it
            is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
            surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the
            biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are
            made of rock and metal.
          </p>

            Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does
            not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old
            English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of
            course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages
            spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.
